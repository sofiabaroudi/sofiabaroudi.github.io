<meta name="description" content="I am a true believer in Epicurius’ argument of the importance of esteeming, above all things, the simple pleasures of life. I also accept the imperative to cultivate a tranquility of spirit through the pursuit and enjoyment of those simple pleasures: “Hence a correct comprehension of the fact that death means nothing to us makes the mortal aspect of life pleasurable, not by conferring on us a boundless period of time but by removing the yearning for deathlessness.” His main point is not that accepting death necessarily leads to pleasure and happiness, but rather that rejecting “deathlessness” means accepting human frailty, developing an awareness of our limitations, and appreciating the small things in life as full of meaning. These are the tokens of being fully alive. I can’t help but wonder, though, would I be happier if I remained ignorant of death like the Biblical Adam and Eve? Does the “knowledge of [our] disease caus[ing] the death of many” give us any more pleasure in living or am I just choosing to ignore my inevitable fate? I for one accept the premise that the soul is as mortal as the body. “Everything fails and is found wanting at one and the same time,” Epicurius would say.
As it happens, absurdly, we all share the same experience of the human condition, which is characterized mainly by our fatality and at the same time our desire for meaning. This desire is a wanting to find something in us that escapes the regular cycle of nature, something that would allow us to enjoy the little idiosyncrasies of our human condition and most defiantly to find beauty in our meaningless life. This is not meant to sound pessimistic. On the contrary, I aim to spotlight the value of savant ignorance. Kundera says it better in The Book of Laughter and Forgetting when he writes, “It takes so little, so infinitely little, for a person to cross the border beyond which everything loses meaning: love, convictions, faith, history. Human life—and herein lies its secret— takes place in the immediate proximity of that border, even in the direct contact with it.” This makes me wonder; if our actions take place one inch away from the loss of meaning, what are we in this world, what is the essence of our living, of the meaning of being human? The great authors seem to answer, and I adopt their view, that the answer starts with an acknowledgment of mortality and the need to embrace, transcend, and live alongside the face of this absurdity, the inescapability of death. As a consequence, small things grow in importance and joy. A quiet, simple dinner with family. A warm bath. A long conversation with a missed friend. Reading a good book. Watching a sunset. Seeing things, the way I do through my camera lens. I mean seeing things in a new light. To look at something is very different from seeing it. One does not gain deep insight until you apprehend beauty against the certainty of death. This is the moment when beauty comes into existence. I believe this process of thinking makes us particularly, specifically human, a process that requires will, imagination, and a tolerance of ambiguity in order to see in things not as what nature formed objectively but as what we endeavor to form subjectively. Perhaps the only reason we see is that as human beings, we seek to make the best out of our mortality, to eke out meaning from the deep void, to allow every bit of life to fill our body and “souls” with suffering, achievement, pleasure, satisfaction.

Perhaps the only reason we see is that as human beings, we seek to make the best out of our mortality, to eke out meaning from the deep void, to allow every bit of life to fill our body and “souls” with suffering, achievement, pleasure, satisfaction. There is a specific painting that comes to mind and commands my attention every time I think about the relation between pleasure and death, Renoir’s Dance at Bougival. The lady in the red hat, joyful and shy as she dances while following her partner’s lead, represents a side of\nmyself the few ever see, one that dances in the street without a care in the world. She dances on the terrace café as stage for the entire world, completely engaged in the moment. In the background is a table of merry-makers absorbed in conversation and drink. I interpret this painting as a unique moment in the late nineteenth-century Europe, before the horrors of war and violence that characterize the twentieth and, unfortunately our own, century. Living for the moment and for the sake of life’s dance is an urge deep within and as strong as my urge for learning, a desire to hang on to spontaneity. As Seneca says, to “vie with time’s swiftness in the speed of using it, and, as from a torrent that rushes by and will not always flow, [to] drink quickly.” To drink quickly before death sets in, that is. I’ve often searched for this kind of freedom in life, but only find it in the subtlety of art. It makes me curious, driven, human-centered and humane. One of my early lessons as a photographer was to enable me not to see life as rigid layers within black and white lines. Instead, I learned to find beauty in every bit of life, from the order within chaos to chaos itself. It is the relationship among the evolving patterns that grow out of observation (Epicurius’ and other philosophers’ observation of life) that makes something look beautiful. I further believe that in this process what counts is to be true to oneself, to find one’s momentary authenticity, as then all the pieces of life’s puzzle seem to fall into place. When am I “truer” than when I am myself in the world? Our reality is tears and laughter, gratitude, loyalty and betrayal, the past and the future that haunt us. This is where I disagree with Epicurius and Seneca. We are inevitably the sum of our past experiences, including those who shape us and make us who we are. These experiences are no less real for being part of nature, for being shared with the animal world. Rather, they are so much more valuable as a result of this: they are true. We are true, we are nature, in one of its innumerable forms. This is what we have come to learn from our ever-increasing knowledge of the world around us. Lucretius expresses this wonderfully when he says, “[…W]e are all born from the same celestial seed; all of us have the same father, from which the earth, the mother who feeds Us, receives clear drops of rain, producing from them bright wheat and lush trees, and the human race, and the species of beasts, offering up the foods with which all bodies are nourished, to lead a sweet life and generate offspring.” This is the reason why, if I had to choose a philosophical school, it would be that of Lucretius. “We,” human beings, are first and foremost subjects who do the observing of the world, the collective makers of the picture of reality that I try constantly to compose through the medium of photography. What is certain is that we are here on earth for an inconsequential instant. The human species may in the end become extinct, the possibility of a greater plan notwithstanding, but while here we should love one another and look after our home, of which we are an integral part. What I appreciate even more about Lucretius is his portrayal of human fatality as a collective, inescapable experience that removes, unlike Seneca and Epicurius, the individual from the center of things. Our worldviews correspond. After all, if not a collective experience, what role do we have as human beings who perceive, make decisions, laugh, and cry, in this great fresco of the world? What then is the meaning of constructing values, dreams, emotions,\nand knowledge, if not for the purpose of our collectivity? Two more questions: Who or what are we in this boundless and glowing world? Are we just slaves of our own reality? I can’t pretend to answer these questions in a few simple pages. These questions are tough and bedeviling. As a young Lebanese woman, I have sought the stability described best by Odell as “this desire as, ironically, the intersection of many forces inside and outside this imagined ‘self.’” I agree with Odell in that human striving is about control, about struggle against pre-determining circumstances, relationships, places and people. I am reminded of ski racing, a sport I have been practicing ever since I was very young. The more you practice the sport, the more you realize that racing is less about winning and more about the challenge: a game of chess, a riddle you can’t solve. The race and other similar activities are not something you can ever fully figure out, because the moment you do, the variables shift. No matter how seasoned you are, every day, every hour, down to the last minute, there are different conditions, different competitors. My pleasure as a ski racer then derives from finding myself on the brink of losing control, hovering over but not necessarily crossing my limit, every time under different circumstances, different variables. The same applies to the world and our attempt to grasp it. The moment we snap a picture, the world changes, it is changed by the camera itself. In that sense, ski and life share the sense of being an adventure, an attempt to fathom what it all means. I now understand that that which made me specifically human, the thrill and sense of uncertainty I get from skiing or reading Epicurius or Lucretius, does not mean the relief of certainty but rather an endless sport of approaching the world and trying to fix its meanings. In the end, we make the world we want; if only everyone accepted this.\n",

      Thoughts on Epicurus

  <div class="post-content"><p>I am a true believer in Epicurius’ argument of the importance of esteeming, above all things, the simple pleasures of life. I also accept the imperative to cultivate a tranquility of spirit through the pursuit and enjoyment of those simple pleasures: “Hence a correct comprehension of the fact that death means nothing to us makes the mortal aspect of life pleasurable, not by conferring on us a boundless period of time but by removing the yearning for deathlessness.” His main point is not that accepting death necessarily leads to pleasure and happiness, but rather that rejecting “deathlessness” means accepting human frailty, developing an awareness of our limitations, and appreciating the small things in life as full of meaning. These are the tokens of being fully alive. I can’t help but wonder, though, would I be happier if I remained ignorant of death like the Biblical Adam and Eve? Does the “knowledge of [our] disease caus[ing] the death of many” give us any more pleasure in living or am I just choosing to ignore my inevitable fate? I for one accept the premise that the soul is as mortal as the body. “Everything fails and is found wanting at one and the same time,” Epicurius would say.
As it happens, absurdly, we all share the same experience of the human condition, which is characterized mainly by our fatality and at the same time our desire for meaning. This desire is a wanting to find something in us that escapes the regular cycle of nature, something that would allow us to enjoy the little idiosyncrasies of our human condition and most defiantly to find beauty in our meaningless life. This is not meant to sound pessimistic. On the contrary, I aim to spotlight the value of savant ignorance. Kundera says it better in The Book of Laughter and Forgetting when he writes, “It takes so little, so infinitely little, for a person to cross the border beyond which everything loses meaning: love, convictions, faith, history. Human life—and herein lies its secret— takes place in the immediate proximity of that border, even in the direct contact with it.” This makes me wonder; if our actions take place one inch away from the loss of meaning, what are we in this world, what is the essence of our living, of the meaning of being human? The great authors seem to answer, and I adopt their view, that the answer starts with an acknowledgment of mortality and the need to embrace, transcend, and live alongside the face of this absurdity, the inescapability of death. As a consequence, small things grow in importance and joy. A quiet, simple dinner with family. A warm bath. A long conversation with a missed friend. Reading a good book. Watching a sunset. Seeing things, the way I do through my camera lens. I mean seeing things in a new light. To look at something is very different from seeing it. One does not gain deep insight until you apprehend beauty against the certainty of death. This is the moment when beauty comes into existence. I believe this process of thinking makes us particularly, specifically human, a process that requires will, imagination, and a tolerance of ambiguity in order to see in things not as what nature formed objectively but as what we endeavor to form subjectively. Perhaps the only reason we see is that as human beings, we seek to make the best out of our mortality, to eke out meaning from the deep void, to allow every bit of life to fill our body and “souls” with suffering, achievement, pleasure, satisfaction.
There is a specific painting that comes to mind and commands my attention every time I think about the relation between pleasure and death, Renoir’s Dance at Bougival. The lady in the red hat, joyful and shy as she dances while following her partner’s lead, represents a side of</p>
<p>myself the few ever see, one that dances in the street without a care in the world. She dances on the terrace café as stage for the entire world, completely engaged in the moment. In the background is a table of merry-makers absorbed in conversation and drink. I interpret this painting as a unique moment in the late nineteenth-century Europe, before the horrors of war and violence that characterize the twentieth and, unfortunately our own, century. Living for the moment and for the sake of life’s dance is an urge deep within and as strong as my urge for learning, a desire to hang on to spontaneity. As Seneca says, to “vie with time’s swiftness in the speed of using it, and, as from a torrent that rushes by and will not always flow, [to] drink quickly.” To drink quickly before death sets in, that is.
I’ve often searched for this kind of freedom in life, but only find it in the subtlety of art. It makes me curious, driven, human-centered and humane. One of my early lessons as a photographer was to enable me not to see life as rigid layers within black and white lines. Instead, I learned to find beauty in every bit of life, from the order within chaos to chaos itself. It is the relationship among the evolving patterns that grow out of observation (Epicurius’ and other philosophers’ observation of life) that makes something look beautiful. I further believe that in this process what counts is to be true to oneself, to find one’s momentary authenticity, as then all the pieces of life’s puzzle seem to fall into place. When am I “truer” than when I am myself in the world? Our reality is tears and laughter, gratitude, loyalty and betrayal, the past and the future that haunt us. This is where I disagree with Epicurius and Seneca. We are inevitably the sum of our past experiences, including those who shape us and make us who we are. These experiences are no less real for being part of nature, for being shared with the animal world. Rather, they are so much more valuable as a result of this: they are true. We are true, we are nature, in one of its innumerable forms. This is what we have come to learn from our ever-increasing knowledge of the world around us.
Lucretius expresses this wonderfully when he says, “[&hellip;W]e are all born from the same celestial seed; all of us have the same father, from which the earth, the mother who feeds Us, receives clear drops of rain, producing from them bright wheat and lush trees, and the human race, and the species of beasts, offering up the foods with which all bodies are nourished, to lead a sweet life and generate offspring.” This is the reason why, if I had to choose a philosophical school, it would be that of Lucretius. “We,” human beings, are first and foremost subjects who do the observing of the world, the collective makers of the picture of reality that I try constantly to compose through the medium of photography. What is certain is that we are here on earth for an inconsequential instant. The human species may in the end become extinct, the possibility of a greater plan notwithstanding, but while here we should love one another and look after our home, of which we are an integral part.
What I appreciate even more about Lucretius is his portrayal of human fatality as a collective, inescapable experience that removes, unlike Seneca and Epicurius, the individual from the center of things. Our worldviews correspond. After all, if not a collective experience, what role do we have as human beings who perceive, make decisions, laugh, and cry, in this great fresco of the world? What then is the meaning of constructing values, dreams, emotions,</p>
<p>and knowledge, if not for the purpose of our collectivity? Two more questions: Who or what are we in this boundless and glowing world? Are we just slaves of our own reality?
I can’t pretend to answer these questions in a few simple pages. These questions are tough and bedeviling. As a young Lebanese woman, I have sought the stability described best by Odell as “this desire as, ironically, the intersection of many forces inside and outside this imagined ‘self.’” I agree with Odell in that human striving is about control, about struggle against pre-determining circumstances, relationships, places and people. I am reminded of ski racing, a sport I have been practicing ever since I was very young. The more you practice the sport, the more you realize that racing is less about winning and more about the challenge: a game of chess, a riddle you can’t solve. The race and other similar activities are not something you can ever fully figure out, because the moment you do, the variables shift. No matter how seasoned you are, every day, every hour, down to the last minute, there are different conditions, different competitors. My pleasure as a ski racer then derives from finding myself on the brink of losing control, hovering over but not necessarily crossing my limit, every time under different circumstances, different variables. The same applies to the world and our attempt to grasp it. The moment we snap a picture, the world changes, it is changed by the camera itself. In that sense, ski and life share the sense of being an adventure, an attempt to fathom what it all means. I now understand that that which made me specifically human, the thrill and sense of uncertainty I get from skiing or reading Epicurius or Lucretius, does not mean the relief of certainty but rather an endless sport of approaching the world and trying to fix its meanings. In the end, we make the world we want; if only everyone accepted this.</p>
